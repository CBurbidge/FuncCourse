# Planning 

## Course Title: 
Functional First Programming with F#
FFF#

## TODO: 
- Installation Exercises
- Course Outline
- All other exercises
- Introduction talk

## General Notes: 
Each Topic can either be Lecture session + Take home exercise, or Lecture session + Exercise session

Each Topic will have: 
- Lecture
- Exercise 
- Reading (Maybe)

## High Level Areas
- A: Functional Programming Principles
    - E.g. Thinking functionally, Functions, Algebraic data types, recursion, immutable data, Monads etc
- A: Functional First Programming with F# (Pragmatic concepts)
    - Mixing Functional and OO / Imperative code within an application
    - Interacting with Non functional code (E.g. Libraries and Frameworks)
    - Performance
    - (Some) F# Specific features and syntax

- A: Functional Programming Design
- Project? Or do project at end of A1 and A2

- How to deal with F# specific things? Separate into their own lectures, or mix in?
