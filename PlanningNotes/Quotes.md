"No matter what language you work in, programming in a functional style provides benefits. You should do it whenever it is convenient, and you should think hard about the decision when it isn't convenient."

"OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts."

"Imperative programming accomplishes tasks by executing a series of commands. Functional programming accomplishes tasks by describing the results with expressions." https://magneticcoredump.squarespace.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-functional-and-imperative-programming

"The core of Functional Programming is thinking about data-flow rather than control-flow." http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WhatsFunctionalProgrammingAllAbout.html

"Functional code is characterised by one thing: the absence of side effects. It doesn’t rely on data outside the current function, and it doesn’t change data that exists outside the current function. Every other “functional” thing can be derived from this property." https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming
